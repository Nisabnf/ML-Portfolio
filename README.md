# ML-Portfolio
A  professional Machine Learning roadmap with 4 unique mini-projects and an aerospace research capstone
 Professional Machine Learning (Portfolio)

**Goal:** Become industry-ready in Machine Learning with  
- 4 unique, Medium-publishable mini projects  
- 1 aerospace research capstone (journal-ready)

## Syllabus
- Foundations — preprocessing, EDA, linear/logistic regression
- Trees, SVM, CV, **Mini Project 1 – Climate-Aware Crop Yield**
-  Ensembles + tuning; **Mini Project 2 – Explainable Diabetes Risk**
-  Time-series & pipelines; **Mini Project 3 – Sentiment Stock Direction**
-  Unsupervised & anomaly detection; **Mini Project 4 – Festival Traffic**
- Week 6–7: Aerospace ECS Failure Prediction (Capstone)

## Structure
See `/weeks` for daily notebooks, `/mini-projects` for project folders, and `/capstone-aerospace-ecs` for the research project.
