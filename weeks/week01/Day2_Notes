# Day 2 â€“ Data Preprocessing (Titanic Dataset)

## ðŸ“– Topics Learned
- The role of preprocessing in Machine Learning.
- Using **pipelines** in scikit-learn to streamline preprocessing and modeling.
- Handling missing values with `SimpleImputer`.
- Encoding categorical variables with `OneHotEncoder`.
- Scaling numerical features with `StandardScaler`.
- Building end-to-end workflows using `ColumnTransformer`.

## ðŸ’» Practical Work
- **Dataset:** Titanic survival data (`train.csv`).
- **Steps performed:**
  - Defined categorical and numerical feature sets.
  - Applied imputation, encoding, and scaling transformations using scikit-learn pipeline.
  - Combined transformations with logistic regression classifier inside a single pipeline.
  - Split data into training and test sets.
  - Evaluated accuracy on test set.
