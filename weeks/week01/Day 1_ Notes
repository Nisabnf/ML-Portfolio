# Day 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning

## Topics Learned
- ML vs Traditional Programming
- Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning
- Typical ML Workflow: Problem → Data → Preprocessing → Model → Evaluation → Deployment

## Practical Work
- Dataset: Iris (scikit-learn)
- Visualization: Histograms for each feature (shape and spread),
A boxplot of petal length by species (median & variability comparisons), 
A 2D scatter (sepal length vs petal length) grouped by species (visual clusters),
A correlation heatmap (which features move together),
A KNN model accuracy printout + a labeled confusion matrix (what gets confused),
A 2D decision boundary using petal length/width (how KNN partitions the space)
- Model: k-NN classifier
- Accuracy: 100%

## Insights
- Petal features are most useful for classification.
- ML workflow feels different from hard-coded programming — model learns patterns.
- First step toward professional ML portfolio.
